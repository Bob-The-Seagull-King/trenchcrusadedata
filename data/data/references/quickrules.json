Grenades work as normal but suffer -1 DICE penalty when determining whether they hit. Flamethrowers work as normal. Models inside the Pillbox are always considered to be behind a defended obstacle in melee, and any Injuries in melee against them are rolled with -1 DICE. Models inside the Pillbox can shoot if standing next to a loophole, but they have only 90-degree visibility from any of the loopholes in the Pillbox.",
