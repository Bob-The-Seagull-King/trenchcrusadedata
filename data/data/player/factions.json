When they reach the ranks of the faithful, the Janissaries, Sultan’s elite household troops, close in and finish the enemy with their devastating counter-charge led by their iron- willed officers. Dreaded Assassins from Alamut prowl in the winds of time, striking the enemy elites and leaders, while the Alchemists of the House of Wisdom unleash devastating weapons made deadly by their elemental mastery, capable of overcoming the defences of virtually any foe."

Though an understanding between the Church and the Sultanate on being co- belligerents against Jahannam exists, the commanders of these expeditions will tolerate no interference and do not hesitate to crush those who would hinder their mission. Resentment against the infidels who unleashed Gog and Magog runs deep in the Sultanate, and matters of honour are swiftly resolved with duels to the death.

To this day New Antioch has withstood eight great sieges and its famed walls, with their seventy-seven mighty towers, have never been breached. This is partly due to hundreds of anchorites, metallic battle shrines with devotees entombed within them, that are embedded into the walls, keeping a vigilant watch over the walls day and night."

These warbands are simply given commission by the Duke, and have to raise their own coin and muster their own forces. However, holy relics, great wealth and fame across all the Christendom ensures that there is a steady supply of ambitious leaders who are willing to risk all in the crucible of war. Competition for loot, supplies, artefacts and information is fierce, and these warbands often come to blows, not just with Heretical forces, but with competing rivals and crazed Trench Pilgrims."

Desecrated Saints are brought forth to act as unholy war altars that pollute and pervert the land which they travel over. Ahead of the warbands fly Pit Locusts, the clatter of their wings heralding the coming of the Court, and their poison stings leaving burns that cannot be healed. And sometimes when the deathly omens on Hell's burning sky and black stars are favourable, a Hunter of the Left-hand path will join a Warband as they strike out of the Mouth of Hell. As the Warband marches to join the Great War joyous and triumphant music played by unseen hands can be heard at these times, for taking part in one of these hunts is seen as a great privilege within the Sheol"

Willing to do anything to escape their fate a million times worse than death, they grasp at the thinnest of straws: Should a Wretch bring down a mighty opponent, the Law of Hell is clear: the mortal will gain its freedom, in memory and honour of the First Rebellion when there was war in Heaven and blood of the angels painted the firmament red."

Demons have to be quick, however: God’s omnipotent will soon reasserts over the existence, and the opportunity for Demons to disturb the world is lost. Thus the Infernal creatures have a continuous and growing need for human sacrifices, pain and endless warfare to enable their supernatural powers.",
