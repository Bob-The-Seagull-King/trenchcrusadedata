They are led by a Master Assassin: one of the deadly Hands of Alamut, with two fully-trained members of the Order.

There he began recruiting volunteers for his vendetta. As a gifted orator driven by the anguish of his loss, Ernest soon gathered a following of many bereaved soldiers like himself. Thus the first Red Brigade was formed and Ernst led his unofficial warband into the No Man’s Land on a hunt for Heretics, through ambush and deep strikes at the vulnerable enemy supply lines. His bloodsoaked warriors soon began to resemble their leader in appearance which earned the unit its name. Their skill and cunning on the battlefield caught the attention of the throne of New Antioch and the Red Brigade was recognised as an official unit in the ducal armed forces."
